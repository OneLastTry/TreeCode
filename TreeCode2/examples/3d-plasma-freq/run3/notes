Run in new unit system:
expected period = 1.114e-11 s
r_c = 4.153e-6 m (found from N = 3e4 = 4/3 pi r_c^3 (because r was set to 1r_c))
t_c = 5.318e-10 s
n_e = 1e20 / m3
N   = 3e4, l = 1

expected period = 0.021 t_c

dt  = 0.01 t_c
theta = 0.7
50% of all electrons with radius r/10
Force softening: 0.1 r_c
